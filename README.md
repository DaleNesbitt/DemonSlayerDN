# DemonSlayerDN
A repo for a DevOps project. I will design a game for the new anime "Demon Slayer"

## Repo Owner
Dale Nesbitt

## Project Management Tool
I chose Github Project as my project management tool as it contains all of my managing and code to one platform.
I could have chosen Jira as it is "industry standard", however, I feel that Github Project looks and acts similiarly enough that my skills should be transferable.
