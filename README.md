# DemonSlayerDN
A repo for a DevOps project. I will design a game for the new anime "Demon Slayer"

## Repo Owner
Dale Nesbitt

## Project Management Tool
I chose Github Project as my project management tool as it contains all of my managing and code to one platform.
I could have chosen Jira as it is "industry standard", however, I feel that Github Project looks and acts similiarly enough that my skills should be transferable.

## Branching Strategy
For my branching strategy I've chosen "Github Flow". I chose this strategy as it only contains 2 branches - Main and Feature. This is easily manageable as opposed to something like Trunk or Gitflow which has multiple branches. We can use Main as our working code and use Feature for any changes or works-in-progress.
