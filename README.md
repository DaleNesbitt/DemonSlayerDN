# DemonSlayerDN
A repo for a DevOps project. I will design a game for the new anime "Demon Slayer"

## Project Management Tool
I chose Github Project as my project management tool as it contains all of my managing and code to one platform.
I could have chosen Jira as it is "industry standard", however, I feel that Github Project looks and acts similiarly enough that my skills should be transferable.

## Branching Strategy
For my branching strategy I've chosen "Github Flow". I chose this strategy as it only contains 2 branches - Main and Feature. This is easily manageable as opposed to something like Trunk or Gitflow which has multiple branches. We can use Main as our working code and use Feature for any changes or works-in-progress.

## Pipeline Plan:
1. Create a new feature branch from main for each task (e.g., feature/setup-pipeline).
2. Make changes or add new files in the branch. (Could be things like making scripts, folders, documentation etc.)
3. Push the branch to GitHub.
4. Open a Pull Request to merge the branch into main. Add my labels (feature, documentation) and comments as if reviewed by a team of 10.
5. Test that the code works correctly (even if it’s just a “Hello World” script).
6. Once approved, merge into main.
7. Setup an automated process to delete the now unneeded feature branch.
